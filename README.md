# BattingAdap
Team: Jake Liebow & Haris Khan

We used statcast data from the entire 2018 season and stored it in Data.csv for analysis
The front end webpage was something we wanted to do but chose to focus more on the content of our arguments and logic than the webpage. That being said it does work and does return Batting Adaptability information from a serverless backend thats accessed and marked up through an AJAX Post Request.
